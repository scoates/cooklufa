title: What is this site?

I've been getting a basket from [Lufa Farms](http://montreal.lufa.com/) for a few weeks now, and I thought it'd be helpful if I were to jot down some of the delicious things I've made with my weekly bounty.

When I bake, I follow recipes pretty closely (it's *chemistry* after all), but when I cook, I often use recipes as inspiration, and don't do much measuring. I'll use that style, here, on this blog. You won't find specific measurements, but hopefully you'll find some inspiration.

I often have a 9 year old assistant. She's usually either helping with the preparation, or holding the camera.
