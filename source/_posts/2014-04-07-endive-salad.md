A few years ago, I had the great pleasure of visiting Thomas Keller's [Ad Hoc](http://www.adhocrestaurant.com/) restaurant.

The food was great. This was in February, so the menu was in winter mode. One of the first courses was a most-delicious endive salad. This is not that salad, but this is certainly inspired by that salad.

The bitterness and crunch of the endives is perfectly offset by the rich, sweet tanginess of the goat cheese, and all of the flavours further balance with the walnuts which also add a wonderful texture.

To make, first toast some walnut pieces over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed pan (or in the oven) until just browned. The oils in nuts burn easily, so keep an eye on them. Toss frequently.

You'll need to retrieve a couple tablespoons of capers from the jar for mincing. Leave the brine behind.

I love my maple chopping block, but for this (and other messy) applications, I like to use a cutting mat.

Flatten the capers with the side of your knife (similar to smashing garlic).

Then mince the capers into very small pieces.

When the capers are sufficiently minced, add a drizzle of very good quality extra virgin olive oil. I used [this oil from Olive Pressée](http://montreal.lufa.com/en/node/2821).

Then mince some more until you've formed a paste. I like to add a pinch or three of kosher salt at this stage. It adds some grit to help mush up the capers, and it helps evenly distribute the salt.

Once you've got the capers worked up, you're ready to move onto the [endives](http://montreal.lufa.com/en/node/625). Mine, sadly, had been sitting around for a few days, and I'd let the outside leaves slightly turn brown, so I removed them, and chopped the very ends off the tips.

Slice the endives into bite-sized pices. I prefer to only use the leaves and to compost the hard inner cores.

Place the endives into a mixing bowl, and add the capers + olive mixture. The cutting mat comes in handy here, too.

Gently stir the capers mixture into the endive leaves.

Next comes the cheese. Slice off a chunk of very cold, fresh goat cheese (the colder the better—you want the cheese to stay in chunks, not melt into the room-temperature leaves). Break the cheese into small chunks.

I've tried other cheeses in this salad, I think it goes best with a soft, rich, tangy cheese. Ricotta and feta were interesting, but the fresh goat cheese is much better.

Finally, gently stir in the toasted walnuts.

We (myself that the nine-year-old photographer) ate ours with a side of grilled cheese sandwich, on a rainy Spring sunday afternoon.
